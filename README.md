# Fake-News-Detection-System

The main goal of the project is to analyse news article and determine if it is reliable or not.

## Necessity

In these uncertain times, correct and timely information is very necessary for us to beat the pandemic. Fake news creates a panic amongst people and it is so dangerous that it has even caused riots in past. \ Thus, the effect of fake news has been growing, sometimes extending to the offline world and threatening public safety. \
Hence it is very important for us to build a system which can help people filter out the authentic news from the fake one.

## Approach

* Random Forest Classifier
* Support Vector Machine
* Passive Aggressive Classifier


After comparing different models, we concluded that Passive Aggressive Classifer works better than others.
